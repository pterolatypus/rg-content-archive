			description = "RG (Reality gaming) is an international online community made up of ex-forces, senior online professionals and military enthusiasts. RG was founded in 2006 and focuses on the ARMA series by the Czech company bohemia interactive. We are an 18+ mature tactical group with decades of experience conducting large scale operations and campaigns as well as providing high-end tactical trainings. <br/><br/>Our group has been playing the ARMA series since 2006 and have a structured mission building team dedicated to creating realistic scenarios for our highly trained members. Our community uses military rank and allows you to qualify and earn specialist roles within our task force. This way you can become whoever you want, if you are up for the task. To make sure our scenarios are as realistic as possible, we use a highly edited and customised version of ARMA 3 for all our missions alongside scheduled training every week. This implies the use of community mods as well as our very own RGModPack.";
